There are many issues surrounding Latin America today that mainly stems from its colonized past, where most of Latin America is still feeling the effects from these past events. Whether its the lack of upwards social mobility for most of the population due to a bad econonmy thus the spread of poverty and rise in crime. These are parts of the reason why several migrant caravans have shown up to claim asylum in the United States which is one of the consistent perpetrators of the destabilization of Latin American countries in the mid and late 20th century during the cold war in what was suppose to be a post-colonization era.
