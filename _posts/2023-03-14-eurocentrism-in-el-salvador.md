# Modern Eurocentrism In El Salvador

## Introduction

Currently El Salvador is experiencing an extreme reduction in crime due to president Nayib Bukeles policies and passing of new legislation which allows for a more militarized state in order to efficiently weed out criminals.

Human rights watchdogs are criticizing his behavior and comparing it to that of a dictator which can put El Salvador in a more unfavorable position in the future, but temporarily his policies do seem to be working.

El Salvador has been in a state of turmoil for quite a while, historically class inequalities, economic downturns, crime and human rights abuses have dominated since it gained "sovereignty" in 1839.

Several revolts and leaders looking for justice and accountability on human rights abuses as well as looking to expel the oligarchy in place and make El Salvador a more equal country have given the Salvadoran people a look into what El Salvador could become.

But the intervention by the United States in its civil war as well as its unsuccessful revolts and the deportation of migrants from the United States who carried a criminal ideology back to El Salvador have kept it in the shadows. 

Having someone such as Nayib Bukele that is actually doing something about crime and looking to bolster El Salvador on the world stage gives the Salvadoran people a glimmer of hope that one day El Salvador could be something greater but this is not without consequences.

It seems that this presidency is more-so about desperation from the Salvadoran people than about actually wanting Bukele in office. A desperation that has been caused by the influence of the United States in Latin America and its obsession over its national security rather than the lives of those affected by their support of rogue governments that do not have the people's well-being in mind.

## Historical Context

El Salvador's sovereignty began in 1839, but prior to this it was a Spanish colony up to 1821.
    
Similar to other latin american countries, El Salvador was ruled by an elite that had little regard for the indigenous communities, the ruling elite aligned more with Europe than the community that they ruled over.
    
This eurocentrism was noticeable by the indigenous population and in 1932 there was a revolt against these elites which exploited the indigenous and mestizo population where they saw them as a source of cheap labor in order to be used to industrialize and modernize El Salvador.

This revolt came to be known as the "matanza'' and was led by Farbundo Mati.

Eventually Farbundo Mati was captured and executed but his name was forever remembered as connected to "social justice and independence", as Care McKinney stated in their [article](https://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=irj), they go more in depth as to the role that the United States played in El Salvadors twelve-year civil war.

His name was used in part to name a new guerrilla group, Farabundo Mati National Liberation Front (FMLN), which was composed of working class people who were in the fight to produce accountability for the inequalities and violations of human rights in El Salvador which the oligarchy/elites were the main perpetrators of.

Around the 1980s several smaller left-wing groups decided to come together under the wing of the FMLN and to oppose El Salvador's government which began a civil war that lasted until 1992.

## In Relation to Quijanos Ideas ([article](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/23906))
    
Going back to 1932 when the ruling elite wanted to use El Salvador's indigenous and mestizo population for cheap labor connects the idea of labor having a subordinate element to it when it came to an era of "post-colonialism".

This establishment of dualism where the ruling elite could use the indigenous population as they pleased in order to try and modernize El Salvador establishes a pattern of hegemony over what were considered "inferior" groups by the oligarchy.

Obviously this angered the indigenous and mestizo population considering that they were victims of human rights abuses and experienced the daily life of class inequalities and poverty as a working class population, so the coloniality of power that spanish colonialism had on El Salvador still persists up until today considering the domino effect that it has had and the further intervention by Western powers has further exacerbated El Salvador's issues.

El Salvador is currently experiencing post-colonialism with the recent intervention of the United States in its civil war and a new kind of "eurocentrism" is born where the United States supports a government that benefits it more than it does the population of El Salvador.

Therefore El Salvador has switched from having Europe's interest in mind in the 19th and early 20th century to having America's interest in mind.

## America's Involvement

In particular we do not see the United States getting involved in El Salvador until about the 1980s when its civil war began between the left-wing group the FMLN and El Salvador's government.

The U.S. involvement was in particular more about national security than looking out for the wellbeing of El Salvador's people.

With the cold war still ongoing the U.S. was scared that Latin American countries would fall victim to influence by the Soviet Union and so any form of political ideologies that involved communism or socialism were basically kept under wraps to prevent any country from governing under that principle. 

This ties back to the idea of post-colonialism and eurocentrism in particular because the U.S. is trying to keep latin america under its sphere of influence.

By keeping latin america under its influence it destabilizes countries where the political ideology does not align with that of the United States disregarding what that countries population actually wants, and so a form of centrism involving the United States appears where latin american countries are forced to align with America's interests.

America stretched the war much longer than needed, thus migrants fled to the United States and some turned to crime.

Once passing of legislation to deport migrants with criminal records had passed, they were returned back to El Salvador without proper protocol, thus creating another issue for El Salvador once the war ended.

## Nayib Bukele and Duct Taping El Salvador

El Salvador's civil war created a diaspora of Salvadorans in the United States.

These Salvadorans lacking a system that could support them ended up creating gangs, a particular one called MS-13 or Mara Salvatrucha which translates to "gang of street smart Salvadorans".

Considering "street smarts" originates from the idea of being able to thrive in an environment that is usually full of crime, it is not difficult to see that many youths or refugees during the civil war in El Salvador and after joined due to the community that this gang brought to them in a foreign land where there was a lack of support system by the local and federal government especially in impoverished areas of Los Angeles.

Once the United States, particularly Clinton's administration made it easier to deport migrants with criminal records, thousands were sent back to El Salvador without letting the government know who they were and so there is this ideology being physically shipped from the United States to El Salvador to further destabilize El Salvador once again disregarding the current population.

Nayib Bukele with an approval rating of more than eighty percent was elected in 2019. Previous presidents have grappled with the gang problem in El Salvador under policies called "mano duro'' or "strong hand". Bukele is particularly popular because of his recent policies and his presence on social media.

Bukeles recent policies such as forcing "a third of the federal judiciary into early retirement" or "[...] the National Assembly passed a sweeping law to block news outlets from reporting on the gang situation" where both excerpts are sourced from Jonathan Blitzers [article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/09/12/the-rise-of-nayib-bukele-el-salvadors-authoritarian-president).

So now journalists would be targeted for reporting due to an intentionally ambiguous law. In order to combat the gangs, "[...] the Legislative Assembly, controlled by Mr. Bukele's party, has approved legislation allowing judges to imprison children as young as 12, limiting freedom of expression, expanding the use of pretrial detention and permitting prosecutors and judges to try people in absentia." which is sourced from Bryan Avelar and Oscar Lopez [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/world/americas/el-salvador-state-of-emergency-crime.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\&referringSource=articleShare).

The state of emergency declared has allowed police and military officials to arrest anyone suspected of being in a gang. Since there is no investigation that goes on in regards to this, innocent people have been swept up off the streets. This move by Bukele is pushing El Salvador into a more authoritarian route which is not ideal in the long term.

## Conclusion
    
Throughout El Salvador's history we can see the discourse of the country being shaped by several different factors, currently it involves Bukele and the crackdown on gangs as well as the future of El Salvador and the statistics of crime going down and increase in tourism which could bring El Salvador onto the world stage. But a pattern of behavior by the United States and the sphere of influence that it brings to Latin American countries is powerful since it shapes the future of the country.

Here we see a pattern of complete disregard of the population of El Salvador by the U.S. government not only in its civil war but also in its deportation of criminal migrants to El Salvador without revealing to the Salvadoran government who they were or providing them with resources to handle the mass of deportees whose ideologies did not align with those of the Salvadoran people.

The United States was able to send billions in support to the right-wing government in charge during the civil war between 1980-1992 but was not able to bring about resources for the handling of these criminal deportees. This influence that has been shaped by eurocentrism has been detrimental to not only El Salvador but many other Latin American countries. We are seeing discourse that involves U.S. involvement in other countries such as Mexico due to the recent killing of two Americans by cartel members.

So as people looking at this we have to ask ourselves whether or not we actually want a foreign nation that holds much more power and is only looking out for itself to actually get involved in issues that it has no business in actually fixing. This pattern of involvement by foreign nations that hold more power than the country that they are colonizing has brought about detrimental effects to the subordinated country. Whether it was colonialism by European nations or by the United States getting involved.
